## ✨ Features

Use **`/help`** in Discord for the same command list.

### ASA Official PVE Rate Fetch & Dynamic Rate Monitoring

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/rates` | Live server rates: EXP, Harvesting, Taming, Mating, Egg Hatch, Baby Mature, Imprint & Cuddle. **Subscribe** / **Unsubscribe** for the alert role |
| `/set_rate_channel [channel] [role]` | Set channel for automatic rate updates *(Admin only)*|
| `/rate_channel_status` | Show current rate notification setup *(Admin only)*|
| `/clear_rate_channel` | Remove rate notifications for this server *(Admin only)*|

### Server Status

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/serverstatus [server]` | Check ASA official server from Wildcard's list; occupancy bar + optional BattleMetrics uptime graph. If the server is down, tap **Notify me when it's up** or **Report Outage** |

### Official in-game notifications

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/arknotifications` | Pick a channel for the same notices Wildcard posts inside ASA *(Admin only)*. Includes a **Disable** button |

### Bothunter (spam trap)

Catch mass-spam bots by monitoring a dedicated trap channel. Anyone who posts there is softbanned (default) or banned. Commands renamed from the upstream [honeypot](https://github.com/RiskyMH/honeypot) bot.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/bothunter` | Configure trap channel, log channel, action, and options *(Admin)* |
| `/bothunter-messages` | Customize warning / DM / log messages *(Admin)* |

**Setup tips:** place the trap near the top of your channel list, keep the bot’s role above member roles, and ensure it has **Ban Members**. Softban bans then unbans so Discord deletes recent messages.

### Twitch go-live alerts

The `/streamers add`, `/streamers list`, `/streamers remove`, and `/streamers setup`
commands manage a Twitch watchlist. Configure Twitch API credentials in the
environment, then choose the alert role and channel with `/streamers setup`.

### Help & admin tools

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Setup guide and command reference |
| `/say [message]` | Repeats a message *(Admin)* |
| `/sync-commands` | Refresh slash commands *(Admin)* |

### Coming soon features

- **XP Leaderboard & Giveaway**
- **Auto Partner Index**
- **Auction Monitoring**

## Self-hosting

**Requirements:** Python **3.10+**, a Discord bot token in `.env` (`TOKEN=...`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Optional storage: **Postgres** (`DATABASE_URL`) preferred, else Postgres REST — see [postgres/README.md](postgres/README.md).
Database-backed runtime state is copied into versioned JSON envelopes under
`data/cache/db/` and the configured dedicated Railway `STATE_BUCKET`. The
database remains authoritative. Persisted values may serve during a
configurable 10–30 second startup grace, then refresh in the background without
blocking bot readiness; reconciliation repeats hourly by default.

Cache timing is controlled by `JSON_CACHE_STARTUP_GRACE_SECONDS` (default `10`),
`JSON_CACHE_STARTUP_JITTER_SECONDS` (default `20`),
`JSON_CACHE_BUCKET_SNAPSHOT_SECONDS` (default `60`), and
`JSON_CACHE_RECONCILE_SECONDS` (default `3600`). Changed in-memory values are
snapshotted to the bucket every minute without querying Neon; authoritative Neon
reads occur during startup verification and hourly reconciliation. Use a separate
Sir-5rM8 state bucket rather than sharing another bot's credentials.

**Developer:** After code changes without a full restart, bot owner or admins can run `!reload` in Discord to reload cogs and re-sync slash commands.
